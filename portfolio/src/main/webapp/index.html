      <h1>Julia Reichel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Julia and I just finished my second year of college
      	at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am majoring in computer
     	science and minoring in economics. During my free time in quarantine
      	I have been watching new shows on Netflix and have grown into a 
      	voracious reader. I have also been trying out several online workout
      	routines to keep me in shape.</p>
