      <h1>Julia Reichel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Julia and I just finished my second year of college
      	at Barnard College of Columbia University. I am majoring in computer
     	science and minoring in economics. I am interested in the intersection 
        between technology and business.</p> <br>
      
      <p>On campus, I hold leadership positions in several clubs</p> 
        <ol> 
            <li> I am currently the President of the TAMID Group a pre-professional club, with 57 chapters across different college campuses, that offers experiential business 
                and consulting opportunities for undergraduates. Students partner with real companies and start-ups to gain hands-on-experience. This upcoming fall, we are 
                planning to pilot a third track, a technology track. </li>
            <li> I am currently the Executive Vice President and in the process of co-founding a chapter of The Women's Network, a national women-led networking organization 
                focused on connecting ambitious undergraduate students with professional workers.</li> 
         </ol>
